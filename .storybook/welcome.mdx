# Welcome to the A11y Pros Accessible Design System

Welcome to our **accessibility-first React UI component library**. This design system provides a comprehensive collection of fully accessible components built with React, TypeScript, and modern web standards.

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/ryan0122/a11ypros-components) • [Npm Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@a11ypros/a11y-ui-components)

## About This Design System

This design system is **authored with accessibility in mind by a certified WAS (Web Accessibility Specialist)**. Every component has been carefully crafted to meet WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA standards, ensuring that your applications are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or the assistive technologies they use.

**Note**: Currently, English is the only supported language for screen reader text and ARIA labels. Internationalization (i18n) support is coming soon.

## Accessibility First

As a **certified WAS web accessibility specialist**, I've ensured that every component in this library:

- Uses semantic HTML elements
- Implements proper ARIA attributes
- Supports full keyboard navigation
- Provides visible focus indicators
- Meets WCAG contrast requirements
- Works seamlessly with screen readers
- Handles focus management appropriately

Each component story includes detailed accessibility documentation, so you can understand how to use these components in an accessible way.

## Important Note on Accessibility

> **Note**: While these components are built with accessibility in mind and meet WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA standards, **simply using these components does not guarantee an accessible application**. These components are foundational building blocks that must be used properly within the larger consuming application with accessibility in mind.

To ensure your application is truly accessible, consider:

- **Proper Implementation**: Use components according to their documented patterns and accessibility guidelines
- **Application-Level Considerations**: Ensure proper page structure, heading hierarchy, and landmark regions
- **Content Accessibility**: Write clear, descriptive text and provide alternative text for images
- **Testing**: Regularly test your application with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **User Experience**: Consider the full user journey and how components work together

These components provide a solid foundation, but accessibility is achieved through thoughtful implementation across your entire application.

## Design Tokens

The design system uses CSS custom properties for theming, ensuring consistency across your application while maintaining accessibility standards for color contrast and spacing.
