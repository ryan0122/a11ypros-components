# Welcome to the A11y Pros Accessible Design System

Welcome to our **accessibility-first React UI component library**. This design system provides a comprehensive collection of fully accessible components built with React, TypeScript, and modern web standards.

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/ryan0122/a11ypros-components) • [Npm Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@a11ypros/a11y-ui-components)

## About This Design System

This design system is **authored with accessibility in mind by a certified WAS (Web Accessibility Specialist)**. Every component has been carefully crafted to meet WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA standards, ensuring that your applications are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or the assistive technologies they use.

**Note**: Currently, English is the only supported language for screen reader text and ARIA labels. Internationalization (i18n) support is coming soon.

### Exploring Components

Browse the component stories in the sidebar to explore each component's:

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the component library via npm:

```bash
npm i @a11ypros/a11y-ui-components
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @a11ypros/a11y-ui-components
```

Or using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @a11ypros/a11y-ui-components
```

### Usage

Once installed, you can import and use components in your React application:

```tsx
import { Button, Modal, DataTable } from '@a11ypros/a11y-ui-components';

function App() {
  return (
    <Button variant="primary" size="medium">
      Click me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

Browse the component stories in the sidebar to explore each component's:
- Usage examples
- Accessibility features
- Keyboard interaction patterns
- WCAG compliance information
- Props and API documentation

### Customization with Design Tokens

The library exports design tokens and utility functions for customizing your theme:

```tsx
import { colors, spacing, typography, breakpoints, motion } from '@a11ypros/a11y-ui-components';
import { generateFocusRing, trapFocus, announceToScreenReader } from '@a11ypros/a11y-ui-components';

// Use design tokens in your custom components
const MyComponent = () => (
  <div style={{ 
    color: colors.primary[600], 
    padding: spacing[4],
    fontSize: typography.size.base 
  }}>
    Custom styled component with design tokens
  </div>
);

// Use accessibility utilities
const MyModal = () => {
  const modalRef = useRef(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (modalRef.current) {
      trapFocus(modalRef.current);
      announceToScreenReader('Modal opened');
    }
  }, []);
  
  return <div ref={modalRef}>...</div>;
};
```

**Available Tokens:**
- **Colors**: WCAG AA compliant color palettes (primary, neutral, success, warning, error)
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing scale based on 4px/8px grid
- **Typography**: Font sizes, weights, and line heights
- **Breakpoints**: Responsive design breakpoints
- **Motion**: Animation durations respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`

**Utility Functions:**
- **ARIA helpers**: `announceToScreenReader`, `generateAriaLabel`
- **Focus management**: `trapFocus`, `restoreFocus`, `generateFocusRing`
- **Keyboard**: `handleEscape`, `handleArrowKeys`

All tokens maintain WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA compliance for color contrast and spacing.

### Overriding Design Tokens

You can override the default design tokens by customizing CSS custom properties in your application:

```css
/* In your global CSS file */
:root {
  /* Override primary color */
  --color-primary-500: #your-brand-color;
  --color-primary-600: #your-darker-shade;
  --color-primary-700: #your-darkest-shade;
  
  /* Override spacing */
  --spacing-4: 1.5rem; /* default is 1rem */
  
  /* Override typography */
  --font-size-base: 1.125rem; /* default is 1rem */
  --font-weight-bold: 600; /* default is 700 */
  
  /* Override motion */
  --duration-normal: 250ms; /* default is 200ms */
}
```

**Important**: When overriding colors, ensure your custom colors maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios:
- **4.5:1** minimum for normal text
- **3:1** minimum for large text (18pt+) and UI components

**Available CSS Custom Properties:**
- Colors: `--color-primary-[50-900]`, `--color-neutral-[50-900]`, `--color-success-[500-700]`, etc.
- Spacing: `--spacing-[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,16,20,24,32]`
- Typography: `--font-size-[xs,sm,base,lg,xl,2xl,3xl,4xl]`, `--font-weight-[normal,medium,semibold,bold]`
- Motion: `--duration-[fast,normal,slow]`

## Accessibility First

As a **certified WAS web accessibility specialist**, I've ensured that every component in this library:

- Uses semantic HTML elements
- Implements proper ARIA attributes
- Supports full keyboard navigation
- Provides visible focus indicators
- Meets WCAG contrast requirements
- Works seamlessly with screen readers
- Handles focus management appropriately

Each component story includes detailed accessibility documentation, so you can understand how to use these components in an accessible way.

## Important Note on Accessibility

> **Note**: While these components are built with accessibility in mind and meet WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA standards, **simply using these components does not guarantee an accessible application**. These components are foundational building blocks that must be used properly within the larger consuming application with accessibility in mind.

To ensure your application is truly accessible, consider:

- **Proper Implementation**: Use components according to their documented patterns and accessibility guidelines
- **Application-Level Considerations**: Ensure proper page structure, heading hierarchy, and landmark regions
- **Content Accessibility**: Write clear, descriptive text and provide alternative text for images
- **Testing**: Regularly test your application with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **User Experience**: Consider the full user journey and how components work together

These components provide a solid foundation, but accessibility is achieved through thoughtful implementation across your entire application.

## Design Tokens

The design system uses CSS custom properties for theming, ensuring consistency across your application while maintaining accessibility standards for color contrast and spacing.
