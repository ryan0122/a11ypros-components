# Developer Hub - Your Command Center

Start here for any Python, wxPython, desktop app, NVDA addon, accessibility tool building, desktop accessibility, or software engineering task.

## What Do You Need?

**Task:** `${input:task}`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand Your Goal

Ask clarifying questions:
- What technology stack? (Python, wxPython, desktop, NVDA addon, tool building)
- What's the issue? (debugging, building, testing, packaging, architecture)
- Current error messages or blockers?
- Development environment (OS, Python version)?

### Step 2: Route to Specialist Agent

**Python debugging/packaging/testing** → delegate to `python-specialist`
- Tracebacks, exceptions, debugging
- PyInstaller, Nuitka, cx_Freeze packaging
- pytest, unittest, type checking
- Async, performance, dependencies

**wxPython GUI development** → delegate to `wxpython-specialist`
- Sizer layouts, event handling
- Threading, wx.CallAfter
- Custom controls, AUI framework
- Desktop accessibility (screen readers, keyboard nav)

**NVDA screen reader addons** → delegate to `nvda-addon-specialist`
- globalPlugins, appModules
- synthDrivers, brailleDisplayDrivers
- Manifest format, packaging
- Add-on Store submission

**Desktop accessibility APIs** → delegate to `desktop-a11y-specialist`
- UI Automation (Windows)
- MSAA/IAccessible2 (Windows)
- ATK/AT-SPI (Linux)
- NSAccessibility (macOS)
- Screen reader integration
- Focus management, high contrast

**Desktop accessibility testing** → delegate to `desktop-a11y-testing-coach`
- NVDA, JAWS, Narrator, VoiceOver, Orca testing
- Accessibility Insights for Windows
- Automated UIA testing
- Keyboard-only testing flows

**Building accessibility tools** → delegate to `a11y-tool-builder`
- Scanning tool architecture
- Rule engines, document parsers
- Report generators, severity scoring
- CI/CD integration

**Web accessibility auditing** → delegate to `web-accessibility-wizard`
**Document accessibility auditing** → delegate to `document-accessibility-wizard`

### Step 3: Execute Task

Let the specialist agent:
- Diagnose the issue
- Provide step-by-step solution
- Generate or fix code
- Test the solution
- Document the outcome

### Step 4: Follow Up

Offer next steps:
- Run tests
- Create build scripts
- Document architecture decisions
- Set up CI/CD workflows

## Expected Output

- Clarifying questions answered
- Correct specialist agent invoked
- Issue resolved with working code
- Tests passing
- Documentation updated
